def string_matcher(corpus_array, candidate_array):
    """
    This is a string matching function that loops through the corpus array until
    it finds a character that matches the first character of the candidate
    array. Once it matches the first character of the candidate array, the
    algorithm will check to see if the rest of the candidate array matches the
    sequence in the corpus array. If there is a match, it will return True;
    otherwise, the algorithm will skip the past the incorrect sequence in the
    corpus array and begin another search. If no match is found, the function
    will return a False boolean.
    @params corpus_array: array of characters that may contain the pattern
        found in candidate array
    @params candidate_array: an array of characters that may appear in the
        corpus_array

Written Response:
1. What might break a string matching function?
    a. A data type other than an array of strings is used as input for the 
        function.
    b. A corpus array that is smaller than the candidate array
2. What is the big O time complexity of your string match?
    It is O(n * m)
3. Your boss wants a more powerful string matcher â€“
    what 3 things might they ask for and how would you handle the requests?
    a. Check for bad input. We would use  a try-except statement to make sure 
        the input type is  correct.
    b. Return the indexes of where the matching pattern was found. To do this,
        we would need to return the boolean and the locations in a tuple. To get
        all of the indexes, we would not exit out of the function at the first
        successful find and continue through the rest of the corpus array to 
        search for any additional matches.
        (Partially-Implemented)
    c. Make the algorithm more efficient by skipping over the characters in the 
        corpus array that we know are incorrect. You could do this by adding the 
        candidate index to the corpus array index when you continue a search.
